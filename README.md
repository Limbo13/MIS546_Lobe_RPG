# MIS546_Lobe_RPG

This program is our interpretation of a game called Weave (https://www.weave.game/), using Project Dark (http://projectdark.net/) as the game system and a ML model produced using Lobe.AI

Some background to explain the above: roleplaying games (RPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons have been around for over 40 years. In that time, there have been many other games utilizing interesting ways to play. Most are played with dice, but a few are played with other things, such as cards. 

One recent RPG is a game called Project Dark, which is played with playing cards. Each character starts with some number of cards that make up a deck, from which they draw a hand of cards. To do an action in the game that takes some skill (lockpicking, stealth, bluffing, etc), a card of a particular suit needs to be played. For example, if you want to be stealthy, you need to play a Spades card. If you want to hit someone on the head, you need Clubs. The number on the card helps determine how successful you are.

A few years ago another game came out called Weave. Weave is also played with cards, but these are larger and custom (not playing cards). For that game, each character is stored digitally in an app (not on paper like most other RPGs), and to do an action you use your smartphone camera and take a picture of a card you have available to you. These might be Stone, Brook, Gale, etc. These are then used in the game setting to represent something. For example, the game setting may be a medieval game, and Stone may represent how well you can deal with being hurt. If the game setting is a high school then Stone may represent how resilient you are to the mental challenges of being a teenager.

So for this program/application, we are combining the gameplay of Project Dark with one potential way that the Weave folks could have handled the technical side of their application.

For the images used during this program, they were taken by a team member not associated with the model building, and thus they are not part of the dataset used for training the program.
